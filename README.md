# Urban Air Quality and Respiratory Health Analysis
## Overview 
This project aims to analyze the impact of urban air quality on respiratory health using a comprehensive dataset that includes air quality measurements from various cities worldwide. The analysis compares different pollutants (CO, Ozone, NO2, and PM2.5) and their contributions to the Air Quality Index (AQI) values.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Global Air Pollution Dataset, containing the following columns:
- **Country**: The country where the air quality data was collected
- **City**: The specific city of measurement within the country
- **AQI Value**: The overall Air Quality Index value
- **AQI Category**: The classification of the AQI value (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy)
- **CO AQI Value**: The AQI value for Carbon Monoxide
- **Ozone AQI Value**: The AQI value for the Ozone
- **NO2 AQI Value**: The AQI value for Nitrogen Dioxide
- **PM2.5 AQI Value**: The AQI value for PM2.5

## Problem Statement
Urban air pollution is a critical public health issue linked to various respiratory diseases and health complications. This project aims to address the following questions:
1. How do different pollutants contribute to overall air quality measured by AQI?
2. Which pollutants are most prevalent in regions with unhealthy air quality?
3. What insights can be drawn regarding the relationship between specific pollutants and health risks associated with poor air quality?

## Methodology
The following steps were taken to conduct the analysis:
1. Data preparation:
  - Load the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook
  - Check the dataset for missing values and filter for relevant columns
 
3. Data visualization:
  - Use boxplots to visualize the distribution of AQI values for each pollutant across different regions
  - Use comparative visualizations to highlight which pollutants are most significant in areas with unhealthy air quality
3. Statistical Analysis:
  - Conduct a correlation analysis to determine the relationships between different pollutants and overall AQI values
  - Identify trends and patterns in pollutant levels across various cities and countries
4. Reporting Results:
  - Document findings through visualizations, statistical summaries, and interpretations
  - Discuss implications for public health policies aimed at improving urban air quality

  ## Conclusion
  The project provides valuable insights into urban air quality and its effects on respiratory health by leveraging data analysis techniques. The findings should contribute to a better understanding of how specific pollutants impact public health, ultimately informing strategies for mitigating air pollution in urban areas.
